Node's event loop is notoriously complicated, but should be fully understood as it is what 
provides the ability to perform non-blocking I/O operations.

To start, it is important to note that Node will execute a file entirely, line by line, before entering the event loop.
While executing the file, Node will store all Timers (setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate), OS tasks (ex. server listening to a port) and operations (ex. fs module readFile).
Some consider this a phase of the event loop, but since it all runs before the event loop begins, it technically is not.


The event loop itself can be thought of as a while loop that will terminate when there are no Timers, OS tasks or operations left to be executed. 

```
const pendingTimers = [];
const pendingOSTasks = [];
const pendingOperations = [];

function shouldContinue() {
    // returns true IF there are any remaining Timers, 
    // OS tasks or operations
    return pendingTimers.length 
        || pendingOTasks.length 
        || pendingOperations.length;
}

while(shouldContinue()) {
    // Event loop body runs if shouldContinue returns true
    // The phases of this loop are described in detail further down
}
```

## Event Loop Phases

We will go into detail on each step, but the diagram below can suffice as a high level overview.

#### 1. Check Timers 
Node checks for any callbacks registered via setTimeout or setInterval and, if they are ready to be executed, executes them. 
Technically, setImmediate is a Timer, however those callbacks are not executed until after the poll phase. 

#### 2. Pending Callbacks
Any callbacks from system (usually I/O) operations are executed here. An example would be a callback passed to the fs module's readFile function. 

```
fs.readFile("myfile.txt", (err, data) => {
    // Code here will be executed in this phase
})
```

Any network operations, like an http request, fall under the 'system operations' umbrella, and will also be executed here. 

#### 3. Poll
What exactly happens here depends on if there are or are not any tasks in the poll queue.  

<strong>If tasks are in the poll queue...</strong>
Those tasks will be completed in first-in first-out (FIFO) fashion, synchronously, until all have been completed.

<strong>If the poll queue is empty...</strong>
If any callbacks have been scheduled via setImmediate, the poll phase ends and the event loop moves to the next phase.
Otherwise, the event loop waits for callbacks to be added to the queue, and executes them as they arrive. 

When the poll queue is empty, the event loop checks for any timers with callbacks ready to be executed.  If any exist, 
the event loop wraps back to the Timers phase to execute those callbacks.

#### 4. Check 
This is where any callbacks registered via [setImmediate](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/understanding-setimmediate#understanding-setimmediate) are executed. 

#### 5. Close Callbacks 
Any 'close' event handlers are executed here. This could be a socket, server, readStream or any other type that allows for 'close' event callbacks. 
For example...

```
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/file.txt');

// The 'close' callback will be executed in this phase, 
// even if readStream closed some time earlier
readStream.on('close', () => {
    // Do some cleanup here
})
```
